Requirements

Dependencies:
- bash
- rsync
- ssh / sshfs
- portage
- portage-tools?! (revdep-rebuild)

Settings:
- /etc/make.conf
  PKG_DIR="/usr/portage/packages"	# Same on Server and Client
- SSH
  running SSHServer on csg-binhost 
  configured pub key auth for client
- Portage
  Portage should run stable stand alone on the client system, because
  the client's configuration is used by the csg-binhost server.
